Random Thoughts & Abstractions.... 
1. Interface signature.
2. Really though, I just start with writing the get queue method. Back up....
3. Wrk through orderby----> Push to later...
4 Wait...How I will I collect all the lesson groups....
5. A string for now.... CSharp.Interfaces.1
7. Where should I store this? When Creating the lesson.....
8 So Create Lesson needs a property in the data to collect things.
Lesson -> Lesson Group
9. This means that we will need a way to collect lesson groups.......
10. use typeahead? ----Pust to later....
11. String for now.... simple....
12. Add to CreateLesson service method....
13. Update Create View....
14. Need a make lesson slide show view.....
15. Queue up specific items in a specific order....
16. Queue method in controller.... Add to queue.....
17 Store order by storing an int for that lesson in it's group....
18 Should have a list that will show the Queue order. 


Wait,  I need a Slideshow Class....
